In boundary representations (BRep), objects are defined by vertices connected by edges and faces. In function representations (FRep), objects are defined by a function f that maps any point (x,y,z) to a real value d, the distance to the objects: f(x,y,z)=d\n\nThe components are organized in groups. A typical workflow is to choose objects from PRIMITIVES, combine them using e.g. Boolean operations from COMBINATIONS, add further MODIFICATIONS as necessary and finally visualize the distance object using a component from the MESHING tab. Furthermore, there are different kinds of LATTICES, some MATH functions, components to convert Rhino GEOMETRY into an SDF and some utilities to ANALYSE the SDF.",

To make the communication between web applications and Grasshopper possible, I developed HTTP server components. HTTP is a bidirectional protocol for serving web contents. Parameters can be passed from web application for Grasshopper script, and the outcome can be sent back. The curves related components of Bengesht are initially created to simplify the process of modeling Muqarnas.\nLater, the Divide On Intersects components was used by our structural engineers during ITECH research pavilion to prepare models for structural analysis.",

It is geared specifically toward wrapping existing geometric elements, and works with combinations of points, breps and curves, allowing users to vary a number of parameters that enhance sculptural potentials. It is still rough (and there are definitely a number of other approaches to level sets and isosurfacing that are faster, more robust, more elegant, and/or have more potential) but due to time constraints related to other work I am doing – now and into the near future – I thought it effective and fun enough that it was worth it to make this available to the community. As such, though, general caveats apply: it’s probably easy to break, and it will definitely generate some artifacts. But please download and have a play, and feedback on the grasshopper forum is welcome. There’s a longer description after the break.",

This wasn't an easy decision to make, there is some extremely cool stuff we've temporarily kept to ourselves, but it will allow us to ensure that this base layer is robust so that any extensions to the framework are built on first-rate infrastructure. Similarly, to limit the potential sources of issues to those at the heart of our framework, we are only releasing this version for Grasshopper.",

      "description": "Mosquito is a plugin suite developed for Rhino and Grasshopper. The plugin allows us to tap into social , financial and popular media. Extracting location, profiles, images and messages from Facebook,Twitter, Topsy etc….\n\nAs architects part of our responsibility is the consideration of the public realm. Today however , people tend to hang in the digital equivalent, namely, social media space. While this space becomes ever more permanent, the physical realm is fleeting, an evanescent space.\n\nWe are utilizing the tools in this component suite to bridge the gap between geometrics and information. Driving geometry with data and vice-versa. The ability to extract user Geo-coordinates, language, thoughts, profile and image enables architects to paint a picture. It is this  4-dimensional picture, which we refer to as “spatial condition”, that allows us to explore what happened yesterday, now and hypothesize about tomorrow. True 4-dimensional modeling.",

Topologic is designed as a core library and additional plugins to visual data flow programming (VDFP) applications and parametric modelling platforms commonly used in architectural design practice. These applications provide workspaces with visual programming nodes and connections for architects to interact with Topologic and perform architectural design and analysis tasks.\n\nTopologic is well-suited to create a lightweight representation of a building as an external envelope and the subdivision of the enclosed space into separate spaces and zones using zero-thickness internal surfaces. Because Topologic maintains topological consistency, a user can query these cellular spaces and surfaces regarding their topological data and thus conduct various analyses. For example, this lightweight and consistent representation was found to be well-matched with the input data requirements for energy analysis simulation software. Because Topologic allows entities with mixed dimensionalities and those that are optionally independent (e.g. a line, a surface, a volume) to co-exist, structural models can be represented in a coherent manner where lines can represent columns and beams, surfaces can represent walls and slabs, and volumes can represent solids. In addition, non-building entities, such as structural loads can be efficiently attached to the structure. This creates a lightweight model that is well-matched with the input data requirements for structural analysis simulation software.",

      "description": "Wasp is a set of Grasshopper components, developed in Python, directed at representing and designing with discrete elements. The description of each individual part includes basic information necessary for the aggregation process (part geometry, connections location and orientation). The set of connections define the topological graph of the part, which is then used to define the possibilities of aggregation with other parts.\n\nThe core of the framework relies on a set of aggregation procedures, allowing generation of specific structures from the combination of different modules. Each of these procedures is composed of strategies for the selection of basic aggregation rules, described as an instruction to orient one module over a selected connection of another module. Currently available procedures include stochastic aggregation and field-driven aggregation.",

The special characteristic of IGA lies in the usage of Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) as basis functions for the Finite Elements. Hence it allows to run simulations directly on NURBS without the need of meshing.\n\nKiwi!3D includes a isogeometric Shell, Membrane, Beam and Cable element. It is able to handle Trimmed Surfaces as well as Coupled Patches (multi-surface models). You can run Linear as well as geometrically Non-linear Structural Analysis problems. Also it includes Form Finding for tensile structures (Updated Reference Strategy).",

The underlying position-based dynamics implemented in the Kangaroo2 solver inherently deals with this non-linear behaviour. This means that both form-finding and analysis can be performed within the Grasshopper environment using K2 and K2Engineering.",
